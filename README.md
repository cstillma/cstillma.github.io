# Unreal Engine Learning Project

> By [Caleb Stillman](https://cstillma.github.io/)

## Vision Statement
This project will expose me to and familiarize me with an industry-grade game development engine. The knowledge gained throughout the course of the project will allow me to add a marketable skill to my resume and a useful project to my portfolio. 

## Motivation
This project is important to me because it’s long been a goal of mine to build my own games. Game dev is one of two professional tracks I’m considering, and knowledge of Unreal Engine is essential to becoming a developer at any major studio. Even if I choose to pursue an area other than game development professionally, completing this project will allow me to continue developing games as a hobbyist.

## Specific and Measurable Goals
- Week 1:	Brainstorm project ideas 
- [Week 2](2025-01-23-Weekly-Update-1.md):	Fine-tune project idea, work on proposal 
- [Week 3](2025-01-31-Weekly-Update-2.md):	Install and set up Unreal Engine
- [Week 4](2025-02-06-Weekly-Update-3.md):	More user interface, viewport settings, start creating and moving objects
- [Week 5](2025-02-13-Weekly-Update-4.md):	Begin working with materials and textures
- [Week 6](2025-02-20-Weekly-Update-5.md):	Material parameters and instances, create master materials
- [Week 7](2025-02-27-Weekly-Update-6.md):	Create a static mesh
- [Week 8](2025-03-06-Weekly-Update-7.md):	Lighting - learn types of lighting and Lumen tool
- [Week 9](2025-03-13-Weekly-Update-8.md):	Archviz lighting - Lumen and baked 
- [Week 10](2025-03-20-Weekly-Update-9.md):	Learn about landscape tools and materials
- [Week 11](2025-03-27-Weekly-Update-10.md):	Flesh out foliage, work with Nanite
- [Week 12](2025-04-03-Weekly-Update-11.md):	Work with Blueprints, begin working on castle
- [Week 13](2025-04-10-Weekly-Update-12.md):	More landscape material, large details
- [Week 14](2025-04-17-Weekly-Update-13.md):	Populate landscape with water, cliffs, trees
- [Week 15](2025-04-24-Weekly-Update-14.md):	Complete castle setting, finalize details

## Risks to Project Completion
1. Completely unfamiliar with working environment going in to project
2. Over- or underestimating project scope

## Mitigation Strategy
In regard to the first potential risk: while I’m unfamiliar with Unreal Engine as I begin this project, I have some experience with other game development engines such as Unity Engine. Additionally, I plan to leverage online support and resources such as Unreal’s help and troubleshooting articles and tutorials in any area in which I get stuck. 

In regard to the second potential risk: I don’t believe it’s truly possible to overestimate the scope of the project - the number of settings and the degree of modularity in each is such that exploring them all could easily exceed 45 hours. To avoid underestimating the scope of the project, I made a decision in the brainstorming portion of the schedule not to attempt to build out a fully playable game, which could more easily get out of control and exceed the project scope. Instead, I’ve decided to focus my efforts on level design - I would rather focus on perfecting aspects such as backgrounds, landscapes, lighting, and other setting details. This is easily accomplished by following the Unreal Sensei tutorial credited below, so this mitigation strategy is reflected in the built-out project schedule above. 

## Project Assessments
I have a deep love of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and have long desired a remaster of that game. What I envision for the completed project is a setting that could easily have been a dungeon pulled from Oblivion - a castle in a warmly-lit, forested, mountainous locale, only with modern day graphics. Unreal Sensei's tutorial has the feel of an environment that could be found in Oblivion, so it made the perfect choice to follow it for this learning project.

- Background: snow-capped mountains
- Landscape: fall-foliage forest, streams, gradient and cliffs
- Lighting: warm, sunlit sky
- Focus feature: castle location for use as dungeon in future project
