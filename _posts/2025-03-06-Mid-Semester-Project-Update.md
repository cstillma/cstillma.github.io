title: Mid-Semester Project Update
---

The original goal of this project was to familiarize myself with the tools and workings of the Unreal Engine IDE by creating a game environment. 
By accomplishing this, I will become better acquainted with tools and practices in game development and more specifically, level design. 
I have not made any changes to my originally proposed schedule and project goals, which can be found in my project proposal. 
I attribute this success in staying on schedule with the quantity of resources available in and around Unreal Engine, first and foremost of which is Unreal Sensei's tutorial found here, which enabled me to appropriately scope the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-zMkzmduqI. 

My accomplishments in the project so far have included installing and setting up the Unreal Engine IDE, learning the user interface, creating and moving some basic objects, 
doing a deep dive into creating and manipulating materials and textures, creating a static mesh, and most recently, working with lighting. 
Many of these accomplishments have been more general learning activities - so far only the static mesh is something that will be present in the final iteration of my project. 
However, these are fundamental building blocks I will need to have mastered as I build the final environment. 

The activities in the second half of the project will more directly contribute to the final deliverable - a game environment consisting of a castle situated in a forested, mountainous area, 
reminiscent of a scene that could be found in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, but with the benefit of graphics and an engine two decades more current. 
These second-half activities will include building the final landscape materials, including trees/foliage, water, and rocky cliffs; building the castle blueprints and then completing the castle setting. 
To reach these second-half goals, I simply need to continue following the schedule I laid out for myself in the beginning of the project.
