### What did you do last week?

Last week, I messed around some more with Unreal's landscape tools and learned some about the Nanite system, which is Unreal's geometry system for rendering game objects. 

### What do you plan to do this week?

This week, I plan to get started finally on some of the landscape details for my final game world, with a focus on foliage, since I primarily envision a forested region for my environment. 

### Are there any impediments in your way?

I have no known impediments at this time.

### Reflection on the process:

I took the spring break to focus more on my other two classes, which was needed; hopefully it didn't kill my momentum with this project too much.
