# Unreal Engine 5 Final Project Report #

## Introduction ##

The vision for this project was to develop an environment which would bear resemblance to the type of world constructed for the game The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, 
using that inspiration as the vehicle to self-teach Unreal Engine 5.5 and the fundamentals of video game level design. 
The goal for the end of the project was to have a medieval-style castle set in a forested mountain glade. 

## Background ##

This project is ultimately about self-developing the skills needed to work comfortably within the latest version of Unreal Engine, a popular video game development engine. 
Unreal is one of the oldest and most widely used game engines, and is the most common engine used in the highest-profile, highest-selling, and most popular video games - 
AAA titles such as Fortnite, Gears of War, Bioshock Infinite, Dead Island 2, and countless others. 
While other engines such as Unity have also become popular in recent years, Unity tends to be used more for mobile or indie console games. 
My personal leanings as a gamer are towards more cinematic, story-driven console games, so most of what I play utilizes Unreal Engine. 
I have been interested in game development as a career path since high school, but ultimately my first degree was in English Literature. 
As time progressed, I knew I wanted to revisit that dream, and while University of Colorado Boulder’s post-bacc program has been important in making that happen, 
this project is the most direct step I’ve taken during the program to make this dream a reality. 
It’s key to my professional development as I begin to look for game development jobs, as this project will be teaching me many of the tools, methods, and workflows which I would be applying in the game development industry. 

## Methodology ##

There is no substitute for hands-on work, so the primary methodology I applied to obtain the knowledge and skills developed throughout this project was undirected experimentation - 
well, somewhat directed, in that I developed a list of topics I would need to understand in the engine in order to produce my final game environment, but undirected in that each week, 
I chose one or two of these and simply experimented with them in Unreal Engine, building small test environments and adjusting settings. 
This was supplemented by reading articles, blogs, watching YouTube tutorials, and Unreal Engine’s own FAQs and other Help resources as necessary. 
An example of this type of supplemental material was a YouTube tutorial I watched on how to add free assets from the Fab marketplace plugin directly into your Unreal project, 
rather than downloading them from the browser-based Fab marketplace onto your local machine and then importing them into your project. 
This was a simple workflow to understand, but it is a much more direct workflow to implement, saving time and integrating directly where the assets are needed. 
This methodology can be seen in the 15-week outline provided in my proposal for this project. 
The first 11 weeks are pure experimentation and research - the finished game environment was entirely built in the final four weeks of the project. 

## Results ##

In the course of this project, I learned many key skills and tools that are essential to know to achieve mastery of Unreal Engine 5. 
These include creating and manipulating objects; creating and adjusting the parameters of materials and textures, including creating master materials; 
creating static meshes; learning the differences between baked and Lumen lighting and when to apply each; how to create and paint foliage; the types of asset resolution, 
(including Nanite, the highest level of object and mesh resolution and how it works); and the difference between coding game behavior in C++ or setting it via Blueprints. 
My assessment of my knowledge of the above skills was to produce an environment which would incorporate the following features: 
a background of snow-capped mountains, a fall-foliage forest, streams and other bodies of water, elevation gradients across the landscape, a warm, sunlit sky, and a medieval style castle. 
To build such a game environment would require utilizing nearly all of the skills discussed above. 
The screenshot below showcases the accomplishment of that goal:

## Reflection ##

It was extremely meaningful to me to bring to life essentially the exact environment I had envisioned at the outset of the project, meeting every goal I set for myself. 
At the outset of the project, I was very concerned that this was too ambitious an undertaking and that I was underestimating the scope that would be required to accomplish all of this. 
However, in retrospect, I’m quite proud of how I broke down the scope and partitioned the work across the 15 weeks of this course, 
because I credit the schedule I created in the outline with achieving my goals for this project. 
I feel very pleased with the results of this project, both in terms of the actual game environment I produced, as well as in terms of the marketable skills I have learned in the course of project completion. 

## Conclusion ##

This project was very significant to me personally for what I would describe as two reasons. 
One is that, on a more general level, being involved in game development has been a career aspiration of mine essentially since I was a kid. 
The other, more specific reason, is that the inspiration for the environment I wanted to create was a particular game - the 2006 Bethesda Game Studios role-playing game, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. 
This game was one of the most formative games to me as a player, really showing what a marriage of incredible storytelling, game mechanics, and level design are capable of evoking to myself and millions of other players. 
This game is nearly 20 years old, and it’s become a trend in the last 5-10 years for developers to remaster some of their most popular games, many of which have been released as “10-year anniversary” remasters. 
Bethesda themselves remastered Oblivion’s sequel, Skyrim, in 2016, despite the original release of that game occurring in 2011. 
Oblivion fans have long desired (and despaired of ever receiving) an official remaster of the beloved title. 
This made it particularly poignant and serendipitous to me when, one week before the conclusion of this project, which has been my love-letter to the original Oblivion, Bethesda shadow-dropped a remaster of Oblivion. 
It’s been hard not to see that event as a sign that this project was the right direction for me to go in, and to continue learning and mastering Unreal Engine, and eventually, other game development tools.
