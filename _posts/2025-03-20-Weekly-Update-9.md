### What did you do last week?

Last week, I mostly did a deeper dive on Unreal's landscape tools, and little more on materials in general. 

### What do you plan to do this week?

This upcoming week, I'm continuing to explore the landscape tools and will pair that with learning more about the Nanite system. 

### Are there any impediments in your way?

No impediments this week thankfully. 

### Reflection on the process:

Thanks to starting a new repo last week, I'm back on track with the expected number of hours I planned for this project.
